# Fine-Tune-Generative-AI-Flan-T5

To improve the inferences, I will use a full fine-tuning approach on a FLAN-T5 model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text. Then I will evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics.

## Key words
transformers - pytorch - pandas - rouge_score - numpy - huggingface - LLM
